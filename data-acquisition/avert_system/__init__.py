This package provides the basis for the AVERT system, including a range of drivers for
accessing data from various different types of instruments.

A collection of utilities for controlling the system is exposed via a command-line
interface (`avertctl`):
    - Data acquisition (`avertctl data-query`)
    - Data telemetry (`avertctl telemeter`)
    - Power relay switch control (`avertctl toggle-relay`)
    - System configuration (`avertctl configure`)
